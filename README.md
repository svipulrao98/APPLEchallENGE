# APPLE challENGE
This competition was hosted by hackerrank
We were allowed to use only sklearn libraries there
SO I gave it a try with Keras RNNs(LSTM)

THE apple.py is the final and required file. The 2 txt files are having the data
and trying...ipynb file is the file I used to test things.

It achieved an 80% accuracy on a seemingly small data. And upon testing I got some cute results!
